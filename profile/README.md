# Simple OTP

Simple OTP was put together after Twillo decided to kill of the Authy
desktop app, leaving only their mobile offering. Simple OTP was
designed to be a replacement. Note Authy has no way to export their
data, so switching from Authy requires redoing your passwords.

This project is written in flutter so it can run on the major
platforms.  (Linux, MacOSX, Windows, Android, iOS). It's licensed with
the Apache 2.0 open-source license and I have no desire to make this
complicated with tons of feature. It's a good beginner flutter app.

# FAQ

## Why is this not in Java/Kotlin?

Sure, Java can run on all the above platforms too. I could have used libgdx
even to get a nice well rounded basic UI even. But really, that's overkill.
Flutter works fine and is currently supported by Google... until they decide
to kill yet-another-project.

## Can I help?

Please do! Send in ideas as issues in the Simple OTP project, fork the repo
and make pull requests.

## Can I do something complicated?

Please don't! The only complexity I'm considering adding is someway to sync
databases between devices. But I want it in a way that doesn't require a 
back-end service and is easy for the user.

## Can I make a commercial product from this?

It's open-source. Just follow the Apache 2.0 license. Have fun and let me 
know.
